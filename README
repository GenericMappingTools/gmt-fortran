GMT FORTRAN README
======================================================
How to call GMT5 API functions from Fortran 2003 codes
======================================================

GMT5 Fortran interoperability is established by a Fortran module 
	module gmt
with enumerations, derived types and interfaces
compatible with their counterparts from header files of GMT5.

Get it by
	svn checkout svn://gmtserver.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt-fortran gmt-fortran

Find it in the source file
	gmt.f90

Access it by the statement
	use gmt

Compile it by a Fortran compiler with the iso_c_binding support, e.g.,
	gfortran gmt.f90 my_GMT_code.f90 -Lpath-to-gmt-lib -lgmt
Tested with GNU, Intel, PGI and g95 on Linux and Windows.

Check examples of matching shell scripts, C codes and Fortran codes
received by svn along with the gmt.f90 in
	src/examples

Send feedback to
	http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt-fortran-api

Enjoy all those 
	type(c_ptr), null(), c_null_ptr, c_null_char, c_loc, c_f_pointer and c_associated,
	type(GMT_VECTOR), GMT_Create_Session, GMT_Create_Data, GMT_Get_ID, GMT_Encode_ID and GMT_Call_Module,
	and more.
